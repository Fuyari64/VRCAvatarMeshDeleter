# VRCAvatarMeshDeleter
An attempt at deleting meshes non-destructively using a select box approach

# Usage
1. Drag a skinned mesh renderer from your avatar to the window under tools > MeshDeleter

3. Check if they are within the bounds of what you want to remove.
4. Delete

It should preserve blendshapes and be non-destructive.
